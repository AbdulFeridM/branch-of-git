Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. 
You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, 
in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand


WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?
Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions that you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!
